# Data Structures

This is a workspace for me to practice writing data structures.

So why go through the trouble of coding what has been coded over and over again?  Well, [I graduated in 2000](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahible) with my Computer Science degree with an emphasis on networking and NOT programming.  As an experienced programmer, I now feel like I missed out on the heavy algorithm courses and knowledge had I focused on programming.  Plus, I'm guessing, I would have forgot most of this by now anyway.

So in an attempt to regain/gain my skills I found 2 sites that suggest programming subjects for study.  The [Get that job at Google](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html) and the more recent [How to Break Into the Tech Industry](http://haseebq.com/blog/#study)  both provide insites on where to focus.  After reading The Algorithm Design Manual and Introduction to Algorithms, I determined that like Math, Algorithms are not a spectator sport.

## Conventions and Decisions

I decided to use the legacy JDK 1.7 for these samples.  At some point, I'll move the Java 8, but my focus is on demonstrating my knowledge of the core data structures and not the features of the Java language.

Also, I decided to code in recursion where I recognize that I can use that paradigm.  I realize that java 7 does not optimize for tail calls, and that the examples will stack overflow with more than a small sampling of test data.  But again, i'm focusing on the core data structures, not limitations to the Java language.
